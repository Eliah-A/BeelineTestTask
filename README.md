# BeelineTestTask

        Hi! I want to introduce you to this test application for middle ios developer position in Beeline!

        The app contains two screens based on UICollectionViews, search functional & cache for images.

        UI is created completely programmatically.

        The implementation pursues best practices and MVC architecture.

        

        I hope you enjoy it!
